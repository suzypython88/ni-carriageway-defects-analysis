## Background
The Northern Ireland Department for Infrastructure (DfI) receives information about defects to the public roads and pathways, some of which through a reporting system on the NI Direct website. Surface defects are recorded using a range of defect categories, e.g. pothole, rutted, depressed, cracked, uneven, etc., the defect location and road class. The four divisions (and section offices) prioritise repairs by severity and risk to the public, and offer a window of time for each project. 


## Business Task

Analyse the defect data for the 2025 time period to determine which carriageway issues are most prevalent, which areas are most affected and make recommendations for funding and resources to address these going forward. 

## Business Questions
* Which road and path defects were most prevalent?
* What time of year do most defects occur?
* Which regional divisions/offices received the most reports?
* How many defects were fixed on time, gone under or over time estimates?
* Which kinds of defects usually go over initial time estimates?
* Which divisions have performed the best and worst this year?
* Which section offices have performed the best and worst this year?

## Tools
Python for Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Data Visualisation and Data Analysis

Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn


## Data Set
Road and path defects reported from 1st April - 30th November 2025. The data set is publicly available on OpenDataNI.

## Who is Reading the Results of this Analysis?
* Division managers of the Northern Ireland Department for Infrastructure
* Journalists looking to report on the state of NI roadways and maintenance funding
* Concerned members of the Northern Ireland public
